9.2.3 What is a User Centered Approach?

The real users and thier golas, not just technology, is the driving force behind product development
- need to make use of human skill and judgment

3 Principles for "useful and easy to use computer systems"
1) Early Focus on Uses and Tasks
2) Emperical Measurement
3) Iterative Design
	cycles of design-test-measure-redesign--repeat

1)Early focus (5 exapnded principles)
 a) What tech is available to better suppoer user goals?
 b) Study user behavior
 c) User charactersitcs are captured and designed for
 d) Users are consulted from beginning to end
 e) Keep users in mind when designing

2) Emperical Measurement
-- nothing to add here

3)Iterative Design
-- nothing to add here

((SKIM 9.3))
Some Practical Issues
- Who are the users?
	.identify stakeholders-- people who will be affected by the software
- What do we mean by needs?
- How do we generate alternate designs?
	.bring in different users and they will have differing opinions to what is a good design
